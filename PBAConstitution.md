Welcome to the Premier Baseball Association League. Established in 2019, utilizing the OOTP20
game engine, that is a fictional league for the amusement, enjoyment and camaraderie of likeminded lovers of the game of baseball. As such, sometimes we will use salty language, and other times try and perfect the use of "trash talking" all while in pursuit of winning the last game of the season. And in some cases, all three of these items may happen!

Regarding the version of OOTP we will be using, we will use version OOTP 20 until at least July 2020, when the company puts out the 50% discount at the Major League ASG. I don't see a reason to force members to buy the game at full price and just 4 months later be able to get it for $20. So we will switch over to the latest version when we reach January 1st in game AFTER the MLB's All Star Game of that year, circa 2nd week in July.

The initial plan is to do things that other leagues never thought of doing, never wanted to do, or felt that doing would take up too much time. We will conduct Real-time Sims for all the important events of the PBA. Well, outside of the Playoffs, we plan on doing the All Star Game, Opening Day, and why not, Spring Training Opening Day. There will be LIVE “on location” Pod Cast’s with call-in capability, a regular pod cast with opinions based on the PBA, and finally, maybe a few things like simulcasting a live podcast via video, which will open up even more content directly relating to the PBA.

## PURPOSE & PREMISE
We're a unique league 24 Team, in the sense, that the owners control the league. It's just that simple.
Each owner, based on tenure, will have voting shares that cover all aspects of the league, including
Commissioner's powers, as well as league rules, to ensure that the league they've signed up for on Day
1 is the same league when we hit the 100 year mark of the league.
